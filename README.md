# Quiz me up... buttercup

I decided to build a humoristic quiz about my favorite flowers: roses. Roses are one of the most recognizable flowers in the world. I decided to build it in a cheeky way, by adding some absurd questions so that the user can have a laugh about it but also get a hint about which answers are definitely not correct.

The colors used as a theme for the website are the following:

rgba(240, 120, 206, 0.867)
rgba(165, 161, 228, 0.867)
rgba(51, 17, 100, 0.867)
rgba(129, 25, 99, 0.867)

RESPONSIVE MOCKUP

## Design process

I decided to go for a very easy and intuitive design with a simple area in the middle of the page that would stay the same both as a landing area with the rules and two buttons, one to start the game and another one to quit the page.

I created an easy wireframe of the game area with Microsoft Word:
